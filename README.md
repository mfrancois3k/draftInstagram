# CSS Lab

## Introduction

One of the best ways to sharpen your CSS skills is to try to recreate an existing style and layout, so take a look at the deliverable below, and build your own version of Instagram.com. Try your best to get as close as possible.

There's a bit of starter code, so you can jump right into it.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Use display and flex box properties to position elements on the page
- Look up and use CSS properties and values that may not have been covered in class, for example:
  - `background: url("YOUR-LINK.COM")`
  - `list-style`
  - `text-decoration`
  - `text-transform`
- Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages
- Use the images provided to construct the appropriate elements on the page:
  - the iPhone
  - App Store and Google Play buttons
  - Instagram Logo
  - Login button
  - Background images

#### Bonus

- Make it responsive. The image of the cellphones should disappear and the rest of the content should be centered.
- Using functional programming (what we have been using in class), implement the following features:
  - When the user clicks on the Apple App Store button, it should alert "Going to the App Store".
  - When the user clicks on the Google Play Store button, it should alert "Going to the Google Play Store".

#### Starter code

The [starter-code](starter-code) contains all the files, images, and text content needed to create the page. The text is in the `index.html`, and the color palette is in `main.css`

#### Deliverable

Please find a screenshot of the expected result below:
